**This is the Node branch that will swtich from PHP to NodeJS & Nim.**

# The plan
Develop Wikipeep using NodeJS and Nim language.

Wikipeep will be based on an in-house micro-framework written in Node (WIP) with some components written in Nim and imported to NodeJS via native addons.

Wikipeep will be a flat file Documentation based on Markdown and git. Will make use of IndexedDB from modern Browsers and will come with a built-in CLI written in Nim.
